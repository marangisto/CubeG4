# CubeG4
Repackaged version of STM32CubeG4 for use with my own build system.
This is a subset of source files from STMicroelectroncis git repository
regrouped to fit in a the simple include / src package structure used
by my Haskell Shake based eco-system. It is primarily intended for
discovery and testing while developing independent standalone drivers.
